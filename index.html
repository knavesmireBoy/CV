            <header><h3>Full time Litho Press Operator</h3><h3>1979 - 1986</h3></header>
        <p>I progressed, as one does, from producing mostly spot colour work on small offset single colour presses to, largely, process colour jobs on Komori Sprint and Lithrone 4-colour presses. For vast the majority of this period, however, I operated a succession of Komori Sprint 2-colour presses and it was on these machines, exposed as I was to a huge variety of work on diverse range of materials where I truly honed my craft, the demands of producing accurate four colour work on a two-colour press cannot be overstated. Within a few short years I was in a position to provide press tuition to new staff members.</p></article>

        <header><h3>Repro Operator | Part-time Litho Press Operator</h3><h3>1987 - 1993</h3>
            </header>
        <p>I had the opportunity to establish a repro department within the firm. A darkroom and studio were purposely built an as above I cut my teeth handling the simpler single/spot colour work before I gained the confidence to tackle the complexeties involved in preparing the firms process colour work. Strategic partnerships were formed with established repro houses for high-end scanning and proofing services. This was an inherently more client-facing role and communication and collaboration were key to correctly interpreting the client's requirements. As the company's order book grew the repro department was able to offer an apprenticeship to a former work experience student.</p>

        <h3>Pre-Press Manager | Mac Operator | Occasional Litho Press Operator</h3><h3>1993 - 1999</h3></header>
            <p>At <a href="https://www.printweek.com/event/article/ipex-bows-out-after-nearly-140-years">Ipex</a> in 1993 the company made a its initial investment in digital kit. As the decade progressed and the pre-press landscape transitioned to a wholly digital it became apparent that targeted investment would be critical to keep pace with the increasing demand for faster turnaround of print. The investment was not only financial, there was a slew of software to learn, and in this brave new world we still had to ensure old world values persisted on the press. Esoteric terms like bleed, spread, trap and choke and creep were crucial to an understanding of how to deliver a quality finished product. Fortunately at this stage in the game we still held the cards and had the opportunity to intervene in preparing the files for press. In 1998 I actually benefitted from a brief stint at a design/repro company in North Sydney, another story, and their blue-chip clients demanded the highest standards. It re-inforced the requirement of organising your assets and checking every single aspect of the job. I developed a pre-flight check-list to reflect this discipline.</p></article>
        <article><header><h3>Pre-Press Director | Mac Operator | Graphic Design | Imagesetter/CTP/Workflow Operator</h3><h3>2000 - 2010</h3></header>
        
        
        <p>The previous decade ended with the firms first investment in an imagesetter. This paid dividends when we were able to secure a contract to provide a complete repro solution for a major insurance company. The second-hand device may have had a slow rip but we now had more control over the final output and if we had on occasion to resort to external assistance we were well versed in preparing print ready pdfs knowing file integrity would be preserved. This trend towards a pdf workflow culminated in the investment in the <a href="https://www.printweek.com/news/article/north-wolds-goes-on-200k-agfa-ctp-spree-at-northprint">Apogee X workflow</a> provided by Agfa along with the Acento, their chemistry free platesetter. While on the whole a pdf workflow had to be championed and seasoned designers understood the value of pre-flighting not all were as professional. 
        Similarly pre-press houses could rarely pretend to have the in-house skills to deliver breathtaking artwork but I had grown compentent enough to provide some decent design solutions across a range of printed products.

        <article><header><h3>Pre-Press Director | Mac Operator | Graphic Design | CTP/Workflow Operator | Digital Press Operator</h3><h3>2010 - 2014</h3></header>       
        <p>The last major investment in the department, on my watch, was a digital press, which was installed in new premises at the end of 2009. As previously with a workflow solution it was largely my responsibility to research the options available but we all decided that, within the constraints of the budget, the Konica Minolta bizhub PRO c6501 gave the most litho-like results, very much a consideration. I was also determined that we should exploit the the very unlitho-like advantage of the digital press, and invest in a variable data solution. KM offered a entry-level solution with the <a href="https://bigpicture.net/article/creos-darwin-vi-tool-indesign-cs">Darwin</a> plug-in for InDesign. It had it's limitations, as did digital print in general, but were we now able to offer our clients an exciting new opportunity and the demand was there from the very beginning. For one of the original directors, however, the end of the working life was fast approaching and in a few years the decision was taken to instigate the process of selling the business. </p></article> 
        <article><header><h3>Refactoring</h3><h3>2015 - 2021</h3></header>
            <p>The company was <a href="https://www.printweek.com/news/article/singh-returns-to-print-with-buyout-deal">sold</a> in August 2014. It turned out it was time for me to move on too. I worked until the end of the year for handover purposes. Since leaving Astra Zeneca in 2008 my girlfriend had moved in and enjoyed a succesion of freelance roles. She was able to buy a dalmatian pup. After a fallow period and unconstrained by location she was free to explore more permanent opportunities in the pharma industry. Things didn't go entirely to plan, but after three house moves we are happily settled in Alderley Edge. In this period, when I wasn't walking the dog, I attempted to upgrade my “web skills”, partly because I was aware what was happening within the print industry. <!--North Wolds has survived, and a few did not deserve to survive, but it is a terrible shame that so many skills have been lost. Unsustainable pricing. Haiku: If we want cheap clothes should we be surprised when we start to feel the cold.-->
                Not that these skills should be mutually exclusive. Knowldege of javascript and (my)sql had definite relevance in preparing variable data work. I have produced scripts for InDesign which save a lot of donkey work, Illustrator is great for creating SVG's, and who would be without photoshop. It would be great to find a role...
                After six years experience of being an ex-pre-press director I feel qualified to do something about my work/life balance.

                We had been printing for <a href="https://rorypecktrust.org/">The Rory Peck Trust</a> for some ten years when the late <a href="https://www.frontlineclub.com/in_memoriam_juliet_crawley_peck_1961_-_2007/">Juliet Peck</a> introduced me to her friend Caherine Cairns who required a website but didn't really have the funds. I agreed to work gratis in return for a print order. A brochure was duly designed and produced and I developed my first website and handed it over for hosting. It has been regularly updated albeit in the most rudimentary fashion, editing the html. The original semantic horror can still be discovered in the source code. Last year in lockdown I thought I would attempt a basic CMS (php, mysql, markdown). I'm currently maintaining the CMS version - it lives on an old iMac - and this <a href="https://knavesmireboy.github.io/poloafrica/">github version</a>. I have recently been in touch with Catherine and in better times I'm hoping it may well be released.

            <dd>
                Our assocation with BN Thermic went back to the very early days of North Wolds, when they were known as Bush Nelson.
                The long-term plans for their website ambitions were ambitious, integrating a CRM and e-commerce solution, and have long since been <a href="https://www.bnthermic.co.uk/">met</a>, but initially they were happy to scale back there ambtions and since we had a lot of copy bound up in Quark files I was approached to develop a basic website. I had a better idea of CSS at this point no javascript knowledge, so this was always going to be a prototype. Nonetheless there was a significant amount of work. All of which had to be duplicated when it as handed over to <a href ="https://sq.gg/">Squeegee Design</a> who had created a custom CMS for another of our print clients, <a href="https://www.showtime-supplies.co.uk/">Showtime Supplies</a>.

            <dd>
                I was approached by Sylvia Sharpe who was our chief contact at the <a href="https://yorkminster.org/get-involved/donate/york-minster-fund/">York Minster Fund</a>. Approaching retirement she was keen to launch a website that would support her post-retirement venture, breeding and rearing Alpacas.
                For this site I was keen to learn javascript and Jeremy Keith's recently published <a href="https://domscripting.com/book/">Dom Scripting</a> was the ideal companion. I was able to include a basic slideshow but the main takeaway was learning best practices from an era when javascript was a great deal more optional then it is today. I also applied the principals of progressive enhancement to the CSS, better to support old versions of IE which would been active back then.
                Until the very end of last year the www.granaryalpacas.co.uk was still maintained, so the above is the last live snapshot before the <a href="https://knavesmireboy.github.io/Alpacas/">refactor</a>.

            <dd>
                After leaving North Wolds, I volunteered my services to produce artwork for a charity golf event the company had supported for many years. I also attempted to enrol on an advanced web design course, in the event it was barely intermediate. We had to produce a three or four page website, it had to included a form with the bare minimum of classic input types. This is a dummy form using javascript, no data is transmitted. I've recently dusted this down and hope one day to make it a database driven affair and maybe use it to learn Node and React.

        <article><h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>I met my girlfriend on a walking holiday and we still enjoy doing that. The three of us hope to be posing by the Thames Flood Barrier within the month when we shall have completed the 189 mile journey from the Source. It will only have taken four years.
            Happiness is a chilled white and a plate of oysters within co-ee of an ocean. I do enjoy cooking from scratch most evenings. I hesitate to call it a hobby, things normally pursued in dimly lit sheds but I do enjoy making a well made cocktail.</p>
