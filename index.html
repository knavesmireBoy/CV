            <header><h3>Full-time Litho Press Operator</h3><h3>1979 - 1986</h3></header>
        <p>I progressed from small offset single colour presses to producing process colour jobs on Komori Sprint and Lithrone 4-colour presses. For the vast majority of this period, however, I operated a succession of Komori Sprint 2-colour presses and it was on these machines that I truly honed my craft, exposed as I was to a huge variety of work on a diverse range of materials. The demands of producing accurate four colour work on a two-colour press with purely manual controls can only be underestimated. Within a few short years I was in a position to provide press tuition to new staff members.</p></article>

        <header><h3>Repro Operator | Part-time Litho Press Operator</h3><h3>1987 - 1993</h3>
            </header>
        <p>It was at my instigtion that a repro department was established. A darkroom and studio were purposely built and as with press-minding I cut my teeth handling the simpler single/spot/halftone work before gaining the confidence to prepare the firms process colour work. Strategic partnerships were formed with established repro houses for high-end scanning and proofing services. This was an inherently more client-facing role, communication and collaboration being key to correctly fulfilling the client's requirements. As the company's order book grew the department was able to offer an apprenticeship to a former work experience student, who quickly excelled when the digital age dawned.</p>

        <h3>Pre-Press Manager | Mac Operator | Graphic Design | Occasional Litho Press Operator</h3><h3>1993 - 1999</h3></header>
            <p>At <a href="https://www.printweek.com/event/article/ipex-bows-out-after-nearly-140-years">Ipex</a> in 1993 the company made its first investment in digital kit. Hardware was a Macintosh Quadra (230mb HD baby), QMS laser printer and Agfa Arcus scanner. The monitor cost 4k. The core software we were now obliged to learn initially comprised QuarkXpress 3.1, Freehand 3.1 and Photoshop 2.5. This software was beginning to reach maturity, particularly on the Apple Mac platform and rapid turnaround of printed material would soon be a reality. But the brave new world of digital output was fraught with peril and the role of prepress was crucial in an ensuring that an equally rapid reprint would not be required.</p><p>In 1998 I benefitted from a brief stint at a design/repro company in North Sydney. Their blue-chip clients demanded stringent pre-flighting routines for the adverts that would run in national newspapers, supplements and magazines. 
            I developed a pre-flight check list that encapsulated the experience of preparing clients native files, primarily to help new repro recruits navigate the minefield of digital output.</p></article>
        <article><header><h3>Pre-Press Director | Mac Operator | Graphic Design | Imagesetter/CTP/Workflow Operator</h3><h3>2000 - 2010</h3></header>        
        <p>Just before the end of the millenium the firm finally invested in a imagesetter. This paid dividends when we were able to secure a contract to provide a total print solution for a major York based insurance company. The rip on the second-hand Crosfield Magnasetter may not have been the fastest but we now had greater control over our print schedules. The ranks of the repro department swelled and now included two ex-press operators, so whether sending files direct to the imagesetter or occassionally sending pdf files via iSDN for external output, clients could be assured that there files had been subject to an unrivalled degree of scrutiny.</p><p>
            The general trend towards a pdf workflow culminated, some years later, with an investment in a computer-to-plate system powered by  <a href="https://www.printweek.com/news/article/north-wolds-goes-on-200k-agfa-ctp-spree-at-northprint">Agfa's Apogee Pre-Press workflow</a> with plate output on the Acento, their chemistry free platesetter. With proofs now produced from ripped files for the first time the department had finally come of age. Along with the core responsibilities of pre-flighting the department had also, since the advent of digital, been able to provide decent graphic design services across a range of printed products, be it flyers, brochures or books. When more than one client began expressing an interest for an online presence I soon realised there was whole new order of technologies to explore.

        <article><header><h3>Pre-Press Director | Mac Operator | Graphic Design | CTP/Workflow Operator | Digital Press Operator</h3><h3>2010 - 2014</h3></header>       
            <p>The last major investment in the department, on my watch, was a digital press, which was installed at the end of 2009, the year the firm moved to it's present premises. As with the workflow solution previously it was largely my responsibility to research the options available. We were unanimous in deciding, within the constraints of the budget, that the Konica Minolta bizhub PRO c6501 gave the most litho-like results, very much a consideration. But I was also determined to exploit the the very un-litho-like advantage of the digital press, and invest in a variable data solution. KM offered an entry-level solution with the <a href="https://bigpicture.net/article/creos-darwin-vi-tool-indesign-cs">Darwin</a> plug-in for InDesign. It had it's limitations, as did digital print in general, but we now able to offer our clients an exciting new opportunity and the demand was there from the very beginning.</p><p>In this period I attempted to upgrade the company website and a priority was to provide an upload facility. This database-driven site became a side-project that occupied much spare time as it necessitated learning php and mysql and database normalisation. Knowledge of SQL proved to be a major asset when it came to preparing spreadsheets for our variable data work.</p></article> 
        <article><header><h3>Refactoring</h3><h3>2015 - 2021</h3></header>
            <p>By 2012 the end of the working life was fast approaching for one of the original directors and in due course the decision was taken to initiate the process of selling the business. The company was <a href="https://www.printweek.com/news/article/singh-returns-to-print-with-buyout-deal">sold</a> on the last day of July 2014. I was failing to make a ferry to the Isle Of Man that very day, and as it turned out another ship had also sailed.</p><p>Since leaving Astra Zeneca in 2008 my partner had joined me in York, rented out her property in the north west and enjoyed a succesion of freelance roles. She bought a dalmatian pup and enjoyed a favourable work-life balance for a number of years. My eventual departure from North Wolds at the end of 2014 occurred after a fallow period of freelancing and now unconstrained by location she was free to explore more permanent opportunities in the pharma industry. 
            A long and winding road has led Caroline back to the north west, and the three of us are happily settled in Alderley Edge.
            Several house moves have kept me busy and the dog has kept my feet on the ground. In my spare time I've upgraded my web related skills by refactoring some old websites from the late medieval period. With Covid hopefully in retreat, Caroline able to work mostly from home, I am ready and able to consider various types of employment contracts, I have my preferences but it really is high time I did something about my work-life balance. 
        <h3>A few websites:</h3>
        <dl><dt><a href="http://www.poloafrica.com/">Poloafrica</a></dt>
            <dd>
                We had been printing for <a href="https://rorypecktrust.org/">The Rory Peck Trust</a> for some ten years when the late <a href="https://www.frontlineclub.com/in_memoriam_juliet_crawley_peck_1961_-_2007/">Juliet Peck</a> introduced me to her friend Caherine Cairns who required a website but didn't really have the funds being requested by the organisations she'd approached. I agreed to work gratis in return for a print order. A brochure was designed and produced and I developed my first website and duly handed it over for hosting. Third parties have regularly updated it, albeit in the most rudimentary fashion, directly editing the html and the original semantic horror can still be discovered in the source code. Last year just as lockdown hit, I thought I would attempt a basic CMS (php, mysql, markdown) whilst making it responsive. I'm currently maintaining the CMS version - it lives on an old iMac - and this <a href="https://knavesmireboy.github.io/poloafrica/">github version</a>. I have recently been in touch with Catherine and, when the time is right, we hope to see it through to fruition.

        <dt><a href="#">BN Thermic</a></dt>
            <dd>
                The assocation with BN Thermic went back to the very early days of North Wolds, when they were known as Bush Nelson.
        With an extensive range of heating products their business was a great candidate for an integrated e-commerce solution, as indeed it has <a href="https://www.bnthermic.co.uk/">become</a>. But back in early 2006 the most pressing concern was getting all of their content out of Quark files and onto there web site and I was tasked with this endeavour. I now had a better idea of CSS but yet no knowledge of javascript, so I informed the chaps that this was always going to be a prototype. Even without the javascript there was a steep learning curve and the exercise proved to be an invaluable experience. Later that year it was handed over to <a href ="https://sq.gg/">Squeegee Design</a> who had created a custom CMS for another of our print clients, <a href="https://www.showtime-supplies.co.uk/">Showtime Supplies</a>. This is what the original version looked like in the summer of 2006 and the design held good for a number of years.

        <dt><a href="https://knavesmireboy.github.io/legacy_alpacas/">Granary Alpacas</a></dt>
            <dd>
                Having worked together on a number of print projects I was approached by Sylvia Sharpe of the <a href="https://yorkminster.org/get-involved/donate/york-minster-fund/">York Minster Fund</a> to work on a website that would support her post-retirement venture, breeding and rearing Alpacas.
                For this site learning javascript was a requirement as navigating a picture gallery was on the wish list. Jeremy Keith's recently published <a href="https://domscripting.com/book/">Dom Scripting</a> was simply the right book at the right time. It was a bible of best practice, primarily focused on educating designers and, I believe helped usher in the age of the modern website. No longer hosted at www.granaryalpacas.co.uk, the above link will take you to the site built from my archived files before <a href="https://knavesmireboy.github.io/Alpacas/">this recent refactor</a>. The sale pages are generated on the fly with javascript.

        <dt><a href="https://knavesmireboy.github.io/cocktail/">The Little Cocktail Site</a></dt>
            <dd>
                In the first few months after leaving North Wolds, before we got to spend a lot more time with estate agents, I volunteered my services in producing the artwork, adverts mostly, for a programme promoting a charity golf event which North Wolds had supported for many years. I also enrolled on what should have been an advanced web design course, it was downgraded and was barely intermediate, but I went ahead and in order to qualify for a certificate had to produce a three or four page website, which had to include a smattering of javascript and a form comprising the most common input types. The form didn't have to actually work as server-side languages were not covered. Since github does not support them either the form on this update merely simulates a form submission. This may well be a candidate site in which to learn Node and React, at the very least I intend to make it a database-driven site, however non-trivial that will be, although arguably more fun than producing a CV.

        <article><h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>I met my girlfriend on a walking holiday and that is still our favourite kind of trip. The three of us hope to be posing by the Thames Flood Barrier within the month when we shall have completed the 189 mile journey from the source. It will only have taken five years. Happiness is a chilled white and a plate of oysters within co-ee of an ocean. I do enjoy cooking from scratch most evenings and, though I hesitate to call it a hobby, no dimly lit sheds are involved, I do enjoy producing a well made cocktail.
            I have Ian Fleming to thank for that and since you ask when it comes to those films, after all these years I still can't decide between From Russia With Love and Goldfinger.</p></article>
