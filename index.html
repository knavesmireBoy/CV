                <p>Listed below chronologically in the order I first worked on them. The <strong>BNTHERMIC</strong> site hasn't changed since the summer of 2006. <strong>POLOAFRICA</strong> and those <strong>ALPACAS</strong> have gone a few rounds of re-factoring, but <strong>modernizr.js</strong> and <strong>underscore.js</strong> are the only dependencies, and some  degree of consideration has been extended to senior browsers. <strong>Unlike a broken elevator a broken escalator degrades gracefully to a flight of steps...</strong></p>

        <h2>PROFILE</h2>
        <p>Self-motivated and largely self-taught individual who made a decisive contribution to the success and development of the - part - family printing business. Over 35 years I had to master a range of disciplines in responding to the challenges and opportunities presented to an industry fast pivoting towards an entirely digital workflow.

            <header><h3><strong>Litho Press Operator</strong></h3></header>
            <article>
                     <p>Operated several <strong>Komori Litho presses</strong> producing a wide range of printed materials on 2 and 4 colour litho presses. For the majority of this period the firm's four colour work was produced on two-colour presses without the benefit of automated controls, despite these limitations the company established an enviable reputation for excellent colour work delivered at speed.  Within a few short years I was in a position to provide tuition to new recruits.</p></article></section>

        <header><h3><strong>Repro Operator</strong><strong>Part-time Litho Press Operator</strong></h3>
            </header>
            <article>
        <p>Established the <strong>pre-press department</strong> quickly developing the skills to convert artwork to press-ready final film resulting in huge productivity gains. Duties included liasing with clients, liasing with repro-houses for scanning and chromalin proofing services, maintaining stock levels and platemaking. 
            As the company’s order book grew the department was able to offer an apprenticeship to a former work experience student, who quickly excelled. He would later establish his own <a href="https://www.incagraphics.co.uk/" title="link to Inca Graphics" target="_blank">graphics company</a>.</p></article>

            <h3><strong>Pre-Press Manager</strong><strong>Mac Operator</strong><strong>Graphic Design</strong></h3></header>
            <article>
            <p>The firm invested in digital kit in late 1993 and within due course both members of the department utilised newly learned software skills to provide <strong>design solutions</strong> for print clients: <strong>Quark, InDesign, Freehand, Illustrator and Photoshop</strong>. But the core responsibility was developing and adhering to the stringent pre-flight routines that ensured digital output was flawless. My press experience proved invaluable in this regard. I also championed the adoption of pdf as a robust solution for ensuring file integrity when sending files for output down the <strong>iSDN</strong> line.</p><p>As the department transitioned away from conventional techniques I was responsible for <strong>guiding investment in hardware, software and personnel</strong> as the print industry underwent profound change due to the remorseless advance of digital technologies.</p></article></section>

                <header><h3><strong>Pre-Press Director</strong><strong>CTP/Digital Press Operator</strong></h3></header>        
        <article><p>A succession of image/plate setters culminated in the <a href="https://www.printweek.com/news/article/north-wolds-goes-on-200k-agfa-ctp-spree-at-northprint" target="_blank">investment</a> in Agfa's Acento chemistry-free plate setter and their <strong>Apogee Pre-Press workflow</strong> for driving output for litho, and later, digital work. Mastering this software was paramount for the successful operation of the now state-of-the-art pre-press department.</p><p>I continued to provide graphic design services for our regular clients and when more than one enquired about an online presence I realised there was whole new order of technologies to explore and devoted a considerable degree of my own time developing the skill-set required for producing bespoke web pages: <strong>HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, MYSQL</strong>.</p>
            <p>My duties once again included printing when the firm finally invested in a digital press late 2009. We opted to add an online saddle-stitch finishing unit to the <strong>Konica Minolta c6501</strong> and also exploited the unique advantage of digital by producing <strong>variable data</strong> alongside standard print materials.</p>

                <header><h3>Refactoring</h3></header>
            <article><p>The firm was <a href="https://www.printweek.com/news/article/singh-returns-to-print-with-buyout-deal" title="printweek article" target="_blank">sold</a> in July 2014, it was time to move on and my partner's pharmaceutical background determined a succession of moves but, along with the <a class="display" href="assets/bolt.jpeg">dalmatian</a>, we finally settled in Alderley Edge.  I had a few print projects from ex-clients, volunteering my services on occasion but I was primarily interested in upgrading my web skills, in particular gaining greater literacy with javascript by refactoring some old websites. The most recent refactor was to a database driven <a href="https://knavesmireboy.github.io/uploads/?cv" target="_blank">site</a> that I had developed to enable client's to upload files, written in php. I do believe that specific languages are secondary to understanding programming paradigms. We may learn to drive in a single car but these skills are readily transferable, to wit I do possess a clean driving licence and a tolerably clean motor.</p>
