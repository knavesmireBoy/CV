        <h1>North Wolds Printers 1979 - 2014</h1>
        <h2>1979 - 1986</h2>
        <h3>Full time Litho Press Operator</h3>
        <p>I progressed from producing mostly spot colour work on small offset single colour presses to 4 colour jobs on Komori Sprint and Lithrone 4-colour presses. For the majority of this period, however, I operated a succession of Komori Sprint 2-colour presses and it was on these machines, exposed as I was to a huge variety of work on wide variety of materials where I truly honed my craft, the demands of producing accurate four colour work on a two-colour press cannot be overstated. The company, formed in 1979, had rapidly established its reputation for the quality of its print, and I was determined to uphold this tradition as the new decade progressed. After attending Kitson College in Leeds for three of a four year day release course I not only felt I had truly served my apprenticeship but ... time was better served providing press tuition to new staff members.</p>
        <h2>1987 - 1993</h2>
        <h3>Repro Operator | Part-time Litho Press Operator</h3>
        <p>It was my wish to establish a repro department and a purpose built extension was completed to accommodate a darkroom and studio. ...gkd... Initially satisfied in handling single/spot colour work I quickly gained the confidence to handle the preparation of the firms process colour work. Strategic partnerships were formed with established repro houses for high-end scanning and proofing services. This was an inherently more client facing role and I hugely enjoyed the process, being briefed by the client, organising image scanning where required, producing the final film which could take several passes to build and visiting the client with chromalin proofs. The concept of soft-proofing would have been alien and unconscionable for all parties, the processes of preparing artwork for print was laborious, but robust, and it was informed by my experience on the presses. I well understood the concepts of trap and choke of bleed and rich - but not too rich - blacks. Even on the most modern or litho presses, running premium paper stock, these issues remain as relevant today.
            I still provided cover on the presses when required and as the company's order book grew the repro department was able to offer an apprenticehsip to a former work experience student.</p>
        <h2>1993 - 1999</h2>
        <h3>Pre-Press Manager | Mac Operator | Graphic Design | Occasional Litho Press Operator</h3>
        <p>At <a href="https://www.printweek.com/event/article/ipex-bows-out-after-nearly-140-years">Ipex</a> in 1993 the company made a its first investment in Digital kit.
            The line-up would not be atypical for SME's world over. Macintosh Quadra (230mb HD baby), Agfa Arcus Scanner, QMS Laser Printer, QuarkXpress 3.2, Photoshop 2.5, Freehand 3. The monitor cost 4k. The future of pre-press took it's first faltering steps. In reality there was a hybrid workflow for a number of years. But investment in the department continued, new hardware, new software, iSDN, proofing devices and imposition software enabled the repro department to keep pace with the increasing demand for quick turnaround of print. By the time the firm invested in it's first imagesetter in 1999 the transition to a wholly digital workflow was virtually complete, the darkroom camera was retired, the benefits of the PDF format was well understood and by the end of the decade we had become seasoned veterans in anticipating and avoiding the perils inherent in preparing digital artwork for print.
            In addition to the core pre-press responsibilities, growing familiarity with the Adobe Creative Suite enabled the two-strong repro team to provide a graphic design service to a number of clients.
            In 1998 I actually benefitted from a brief stint at a graphic design company in North Sydney, another story, who digitally prepared adverts for insertion into major newspapers, supplements and magazines. That experience led to a better organised system for managing assets and contributed to the production of a robust artwork check list, anticipating somewhat the pre-flighting software then beginning to emerge.

        <h2>2000 - 2010</h2>
        <h3>Pre-Press Manager | Mac Operator | Graphic Design | Imagesetter/CTP/Workflow Operator</h3>
        <p>The investment in the imagesetter truly paid off when we were able to secure a contract to provide a complete repro solution for a major insurance company. ..partners...However the Crosfield rip was painfully slow and the final film still - 25 years on - had to be carefully positioned in a printing down frame. ...funding... By mid-decade the move to computer-to-plate was screamingly obvious. We dipped our toe with an initial investment in a series of Highwater CTP devices, before finally arriving at the state-of-the art solution with the <a href="https://www.printweek.com/news/article/north-wolds-goes-on-200k-agfa-ctp-spree-at-northprint">Apogee X workflow</a> provided by Agfa along with the Acento, their chemistry free platesetter.</p>
        
        ..training Apogeee...
        
        <p>I continued to provide graphic design services for a number of clients and had began to dabble with web design, learning enough <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bulletproof-Web-Design-flexibility-Professional/dp/0321509021">css</a>, and later <a href="https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781430233893">DOM Scripting</a>, to produce a handful of modest sites and, later still, a database-driven utility site (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/PHP-MySQL-Novice-Kevin-Yank/dp/0987153080">php/mysql</a>) that allowed our clients to upload their files and allowed us to upload our "proofs".
        <h2>2010 - 2014</h2>
        <h3>Pre-Press Manager | Mac Operator | Graphic Design | Imagesetter/CTP/Workflow Operator | Digital Press Operator</h3>
        <p>The company had moved to larger premises in early 2009 and a custom based studio was built large enough to accommodate a digital press, a long-held aspiration. As with a workflow solution before it was largely my responsibility to research the options available and we decided the Konica Minolta bizhub PRO c6501 gave the most litho-like results, very much a consideration. We elected for an inline finishing solutionbut I was more determined we should exploit the clear advantage of a digital press, and invest in a variable data solution. KM offered an entry level solution in the Darwin plug-in for Adobe InDesign, that depended on spreadsheet format. Having learned some <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Simply-SQL-Rudy-Limeback/dp/0980455251/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=52735706065&dchild=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIr_7ejoae8AIVWe7tCh2WzQC4EAAYASAAEgLXwfD_BwE&hvadid=259112170444&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=1007234&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=9319941263640526870&hvtargid=kwd-300825111984&hydadcr=17576_1775144&keywords=simply+sql&qid=1619513551&sr=8-1">SQL</a> proved advantageous when the data supplied sometimes required being flattened into a single excel file, or, more likely de-duplicating. Darwin provided some simple out of the box script routines for manipulating records. Thse could be tweaked with JS knowledge, but a greater benefit was the ability to script InDesign which proved useful in a number of scenarios, especially preparing cut and stack impositions.
            The installation of the digital press took place at the end of the decade. We were satisfied with the quality and it became a new source of revenue. A new era had begun. However for one of the original directors retirement age was looming and before too long the hard decision was made to start looking for a buyer.

        <p><h2>2015 - 2021</h2>
        <h3>Dog Walker</h3>
        <p>
            The company was <a href="https://www.printweek.com/news/article/singh-returns-to-print-with-buyout-deal">sold</a> in August 2014. I was out of picture from that day. Long story short, my services we're no longer required. I worked until the end of the year to provide support in this transition period, it turned out it was time for a change of scene after all.
            Unconstrained by location my girlfriend was now able to explore new opportunities in the pharma industry. What followed was a bit of a bumpy journey but we finally settled into a new home in mid 2018 after two lengthy spells of renting.
            I assisted an ex-client with converting a slew of 60pp booklets from old file formats to InDesign, volunteered my services producing artwork and organising print of a programme for a charity golf event that North Wolds had always supported, I attempted to enroll on an advanced web-design course it was barely intermediate, but I got a certificate on producing a website.
            I was kept busy with a succession of house moves, organising house re-modelling and plenty of decorating. 
            I've spent a lot of time upgrading some old sites for the smart-phone age, mainly as a means of improving my web skillset.
            I'm very aware that this whole ecosytem has changed and I could benefit from an opprtunity...
            Above all I have enjoyed the time walking the Dalmatian, they are not with us long enough and in that respect I spent my time well.</p>
