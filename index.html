                <p>Listed below - hosted on <strong>github</strong> - in the order I first worked on them.</p><p>The <strong>BNTHERMIC</strong> site hasn't changed since the summer of 2006. <strong>POLOAFRICA</strong> and  <strong>ALPACAS</strong> have gone a few rounds of re-factoring, but <strong>modernizr.js</strong> and <strong>underscore.js</strong> are the only dependencies, and some  degree of consideration has been extended to senior browsers. <strong>Unlike a broken elevator a broken escalator degrades gracefully to a flight of steps...</strong></p>

        <h2>PROFILE</h2>
        <p>Self-motivated and largely self-taught individual who made a decisive contribution to the success and development of the - part - family printing business. Over 35 years I had to master a range of disciplines joining an industry soon to pivot towards an entirely digital workflow. 
        </p>
             <p>Attention to detail was critical in all my roles and front of mind when mentoring new recruits. In more recent years the related virtues of focus and tenacity have served me well in negotiating the increasingly <a href="https://andreasbm.github.io/web-skills/" target="_blank">complex</a> field of web development, things having moved on somewhat since I completed this <a href="https://knavesmireboy.github.io/web_cert" target="_blank" >web design course</a>. I've progressed too, finally convincing myself that I have enough grounding in the key skills and more than enough enthusiasm to learn new ones to make a positive contribution to this corner of the economy.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Operated a series of <strong>Komori litho</strong> presses producing a wide range of printed materials on both 2, 4 and 5 colour machines</li>
                <li>Provided <strong>tuition</strong> for new recruits on the above presses</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For the majority of this period the firm's four colour work was produced on <a class="slide">two-colour</a> presses without the benefit of automated controls, despite these limitations the company established an enviable reputation for quality colour work delivered at speed.</p>

                <ul>
                <li>On my own instigation I established the <strong>pre-press department</strong></li>
                <li>Developed the <strong>darkroom</strong> skills to convert artwork to press-ready final film</li>
                <li>Maintained stock levels of film, chemistry, plates and mission critical accessories</li>
                    <li>Learned the art and science of <strong>imposition</strong> for print production</li>
                <li>This <strong>client-facing</strong> role fostered close collaboration with clients and trade colleagues</li>
                </ul>
        <p>The department became a major source of revenue. As the companyâ€™s order book grew we gladly offered an apprenticeship to a former work experience student, who quickly excelled. He would later establish his own graphics company.</p></article>

            <h3><strong>Pre-Press Manager</strong><strong>Mac Operator</strong><strong>Graphic Design</strong></h3></header>
            <article>
                <ul><li>Responsible for introducing <strong>digital</strong> kit into the pre-press department</li>
                <li>Developed stringent <strong>pre-flighting</strong> routines to ensure flawless digital output</li>
                <li>Utilised software skills to provide <strong>design solutions</strong> for print clients: <strong>QuarkXPress, Freehand, Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign</strong></li>
                    <li>Championed the adoption of <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr> as a robust solution for ensuring <strong>file integrity</strong> when sending files via <abbr title="Integrated Services Digital Network">iSDN</abbr> for external film output.</li>
                    <li>Guided investment in <strong>hardware, software and personnel</strong> as the department transitioned away from conventional techniques. </li>
                </ul>
            <p>TL;DR; In 1998 a brief time spent working at a design/repro company in North Sydney encouraged me to develop a pre-flight <a href="https://knavesmireboy.github.io/preflight/" target="_blank" title="Link to PDF of preflight form">form</a> primarily to help new repro recruits navigate the minefield of digital output.</p></article></section>

            <ul>
                <li>A series of image/platesetters allowed the department to regain control of digital output</li>
                <li>Mastered the <strong>Apogee Pre-Press</strong>  workflow software, integral to a major <a href="https://www.printweek.com/news/article/north-wolds-goes-on-200k-agfa-ctp-spree-at-northprint" target="_blank" title="printweek article">upgrade</a> of the pre-press operation</li>
                <li>Researched the digital print market for print and finishing options</li>
                <li>Exploited the unique advantage of digital by opting to add a <strong>variable data</strong> solution.</li>
                <li>Key operator of the <strong>Konica Minolta c6501</strong> digital press complete with saddle-stitch finishing unit</li>
                <li>Deployed SQL and JS knowledge in preparing files fit for variable data output</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I continued to provide graphic design services for our regular clients and when more than one enquired about an online presence I realised there was whole new order of technologies to explore and I devoted a considerable amount of my own time developing the skill-set required for producing bespoke web pages: <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, <abbr title="Javascript">JS</abbr>, <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr>, <abbr title="My Structured Query Language">MYSQL</abbr></p>

I had a few print projects from ex-clients, volunteering my services on occasion, but I was primarily interested in upgrading my web skills, in particular gaining greater literacy with javascript. To this end I refactored some old web projects, along the way discovering <abbr title="Object Oriented Principles">OOP</abbr> principles, design patterns, programming paradigms and the strange ways of <strong>git</strong>.</p>

        <p>I met my partner on a walking holiday, still our favourite kind of trip. Mostly on the continent. The <a class="slide">dog</a> is happier on home turf however and last May we finally completed the Thames Path, a project started in our stint down south in 2016. I enjoy cooking from scratch most evenings and have long enjoyed stirring or shaking but inevitably imbibing a properly prepared cocktail. We don't have to travel too far to find <a class="slide">exotic booze</a> these days. No longer do I need to contact New York for options on orange bitters or blindly roam the streets of London in a vain attempt to secure a bottle of creme-de-menthe blanc.</p></article></section></div></section></main></div>
