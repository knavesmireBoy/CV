            <header><h3>Full time Litho Press Operator</h3><h3>1979 - 1986</h3></header>
        <p>I progressed, as one does, from producing mostly spot colour work on small offset single colour presses to, largely, process colour jobs on Komori Sprint and Lithrone 4-colour presses. For vast the majority of this period, however, I operated a succession of Komori Sprint 2-colour presses and it was on these machines, exposed as I was to a huge variety of work on diverse range of materials where I truly honed my craft, the demands of producing accurate four colour work on a two-colour press cannot be overstated. Within a few short years I was in a position to provide press tuition to new staff members.</p></article>

        <header><h3>Repro Operator | Part-time Litho Press Operator</h3><h3>1987 - 1993</h3>
            </header>
        <p>I had the opportunity to establish a repro department within the firm. A darkroom and studio were purposely built an as above I cut my teeth handling the simpler single/spot colour work before I gained the confidence to tackle the complexeties involved in preparing the firms process colour work. Strategic partnerships were formed with established repro houses for high-end scanning and proofing services. This was an inherently more client-facing role and communication and collaboration were key to correctly interpreting the client's requirements. As the company's order book grew the repro department was able to offer an apprenticeship to a former work experience student.</p>

        <h3>Pre-Press Manager | Mac Operator | Occasional Litho Press Operator</h3><h3>1993 - 1999</h3></header>
            <p>At <a href="https://www.printweek.com/event/article/ipex-bows-out-after-nearly-140-years">Ipex</a> in 1993 the company made a its initial investment in digital kit. As the decade progressed and the pre-press landscape transitioned to digital it became apparent how critical continued investment would be to keep pace with the increasing demand for faster turnaround of print. The investment was not only financial, there was a slew of software to learn, and in this brave new world we still had to ensure old world values persisted on the press. Esoteric terms like bleed, spread, trap and choke and creep were crucial to an understanding of how to deliver a quality finished product. Fortunately in this decade we still had the opportunity to intervene in preparing the files for press. In 1998 I actually benefitted from a brief stint at a design/repro company in North Sydney, another story, and their blue-chip clients demanded the highest standards. It re-inforced the requirement of organising your assets and checking every single aspect of the job. I developed a pre-flight check-list to reflect this discipline.</p></article>
        <article><header><h3>Pre-Press Director | Mac Operator | Graphic Design | Imagesetter/CTP/Workflow Operator</h3><h3>2000 - 2010</h3></header>
        
        
        <p>The previous decade ended with the firms first investment in an imagesetter. This paid dividends when we were able to secure a contract to provide a complete repro solution for a major insurance company. The second-hand device may have had a slow rip but we now had more control over the final output and if we had on occasion to resort to external assistance we were well versed in preparing print ready pdfs knowing file integrity would be preserved. This trend towards a pdf workflow culminated in the investment in the <a href="https://www.printweek.com/news/article/north-wolds-goes-on-200k-agfa-ctp-spree-at-northprint">Apogee X workflow</a> provided by Agfa along with the Acento, their chemistry free platesetter. While on the whole a pdf workflow had to be championed and seasoned designers understood the value of pre-flighting not all were as professional. 
        Similarly pre-press houses could rarely pretend to have the in-house skills to deliver breathtaking artwork but I had grown compentent enough to provide some decent design solutions across a range of printed products.

        <article><header><h3>Pre-Press Director | Mac Operator | Graphic Design | CTP/Workflow Operator | Digital Press Operator</h3><h3>2010 - 2014</h3></header>       
        <p>The last major investment in the department, on my watch, was a digital press, which was installed in new premises at the end of 2009. As previously with a workflow solution it was largely my responsibility to research the options available but we all decided that, within the constraints of the budget, the Konica Minolta bizhub PRO c6501 gave the most litho-like results, very much a consideration. I was also determined that we should exploit the the very unlitho-like advantage of the digital press, and invest in a variable data solution. KM offered a entry-level solution with the <a href="https://bigpicture.net/article/creos-darwin-vi-tool-indesign-cs">Darwin</a> plug-in for InDesign. It had it's limitations, as did digital print in general, but were we now able to offer our clients an exciting new opportunity and the demand was there from the very beginning. For one of the original directors, however, the end of the working life was fast approaching and in a few years the decision was taken to instigate the process of selling the business. </p></article> 
        <article><header><h3>Refactoring</h3><h3>2015 - 2021</h3></header>
            <p>The company was <a href="https://www.printweek.com/news/article/singh-returns-to-print-with-buyout-deal">sold</a> in August 2014. The new owner got on with doing it his way. I worked until the end of the year. Since leaving Astra Zeneca my girlfriend moved in and did a bit of freelancing, but now unconstrained by location she was able to explore new opportunities in the pharma industry. After three house moves we are happily settled in Alderley Edge and I have enjoyed my free time walking the Dalmatian. Another prerogative has been the attempt to upgrade my "web skills". I've done this by constantly, oh boy, refactoring some websites I last worked on in the mid-noughties.
            Even before the challenges the last year has brought I suspect I wouldn't have been the last person to leave the industry.
                If we all want cheaper clothes should we really be surprised when we start to feel the cold.
        </p>
        <p>Now with six years experience of being an ex-pre-press director I feel I am now qualified to do something about my work/life balance</p>

        <article><h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>I met my girlfriend on a walking holiday and we still enjoy doing that. The three of us hope to be posing by the Thames Flood Barrier within the month when we shall have completed the 189 mile journey from the Source. It will only have taken four years.
            Happiness is a chilled white and a plate of oysters within co-ee of an ocean. I do enjoy cooking from scratch most night. I hesitate to call it a hobby, things normally pursued in dimly lit sheds but I do enjoy making a well made cocktail</p>
