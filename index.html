            <header><h3>Full time Litho Press Operator</h3><h3>1979 - 1986</h3></header>
        <p>I progressed from producing mostly spot colour work on small offset single colour presses to, largely, process colour jobs on Komori Sprint and Lithrone 4-colour presses. For vast the majority of this period, however, I operated a succession of Komori Sprint 2-colour presses and it was on these machines, exposed as I was to a huge variety of work on a diverse range of materials where I truly honed my craft, the demands of producing accurate four colour work on a two-colour press, with purely manual controls, cannot be overstated. Within a few short years I was in a position to provide press tuition to new staff members.</p></article>

        <header><h3>Repro Operator | Part-time Litho Press Operator</h3><h3>1987 - 1993</h3>
            </header>
        <p>I had the opportunity to establish a repro department within the firm. A darkroom and studio were purposely built an as above I cut my teeth handling the simpler single/spot colour work before I gained the confidence to tackle the complexeties involved in preparing the firms process colour work. Strategic partnerships were formed with established repro houses for high-end scanning and proofing services. This was an inherently more client-facing role and communication and collaboration being key to correctly interpreting the client's requirements. As the company's order book grew the repro department was able to offer an apprenticeship to a former work experience student.</p>

        <h3>Pre-Press Manager | Mac Operator | Occasional Litho Press Operator</h3><h3>1993 - 1999</h3></header>
            <p>At <a href="https://www.printweek.com/event/article/ipex-bows-out-after-nearly-140-years">Ipex</a> in 1993 the company made a its initial investment in digital kit and as the decade progressed and the pre-press landscape transitioned to a wholly digital workflow it became apparent that targeted investment would be critical in keeping pace with the increasing demand for fast turnaround of print. The investment was not purely financial, there was a slew of software to learn, and in this brave new world we still had to ensure that old world values persisted on the press. An understanding of esoteric terms like bleed, spread, trap and choke and creep were crucial in delivering a quality finished product. At this stage most designers were more than happy to entrust the preparation of their work to prepress professionals. In 1998 I actually benefitted from a brief stint at a design/repro company in North Sydney, another story, and their blue-chip clients demanded the highest standards. It re-inforced the requirement of organising your assets and checking every single aspect of the job. I developed a pre-flight check-list to reflect this discipline.</p></article>
        <article><header><h3>Pre-Press Director | Mac Operator | Graphic Design | Imagesetter/CTP/Workflow Operator</h3><h3>2000 - 2010</h3></header>        
        <p>Just before the millenium was out the firm finally invested in a imagesetter. This paid dividends when we were able to secure a contract to provide a complete repro solution for a major York based insurance company. The second-hand device was no Maserati but we now had more control over the final output and if we had on occasion to resort to external assistance we made sure that the pdf's we sent down the iSDN line print were produced to exacting standards. The trend towards a pdf workflow that culminated in an investment in the <a href="https://www.printweek.com/news/article/north-wolds-goes-on-200k-agfa-ctp-spree-at-northprint">Apogee X workflow</a> provided by Agfa along with the Acento, their chemistry free platesetter, and a copy of Pitstop-Pro became invaluable as the ability to safely edit client pdf files became an increasing neccesity. This period was probably my most productive in design work. I could never claim that anything I produced ascended the heights of invention, you know great design when you see it and we saw plenty of it, but I was grown compentent enough to provide some decent design solutions across a range of printed products. I also began to learn the skills required to produce a few modest websites which included a database driven site that allowed clients to upload their files.

        <article><header><h3>Pre-Press Director | Mac Operator | Graphic Design | CTP/Workflow Operator | Digital Press Operator</h3><h3>2010 - 2014</h3></header>       
        <p>The last major investment in the department, on my watch, was a digital press, which was installed in new premises at the end of 2009. As previously with a workflow solution it was largely my responsibility to research the options available but we unanimous in deciding, within the constraints of the budget, that the Konica Minolta bizhub PRO c6501 gave the most litho-like results, very much a consideration. I was also determined that we should exploit the the very unlitho-like advantage of the digital press, and invest in a variable data solution. KM offered a entry-level solution with the <a href="https://bigpicture.net/article/creos-darwin-vi-tool-indesign-cs">Darwin</a> plug-in for InDesign. It had it's limitations, as did digital print in general, but were we now able to offer our clients an exciting new opportunity and the demand was there from the very beginning. For one of the original directors, however, the end of the working life was fast approaching and shortly after the decision was taken to instigate the process of selling the business. </p></article> 
        <article><header><h3>Refactoring</h3><h3>2015 - 2021</h3></header>
            <p>The company was <a href="https://www.printweek.com/news/article/singh-returns-to-print-with-buyout-deal">sold</a> in August 2014. It turned out it was time for me to move on too. I worked until the end of the year for handover purposes. Since leaving Astra Zeneca in 2008 my girlfriend joined me in York, rented out her property in the north west and enjoyed a succesion of freelance roles. She was in a position to buy a dalmatian pup and enjoyed a favourable work-life balance for a number of years. My depature occurred at a fallow period of freelancing and now unconstrained by location she was free to explore more permanent opportunities in the pharma industry. Things didn't go entirely to plan, but after three house moves we are happily settled in back in the north west in Alderley Edge, the old AZ site is currently a major vaccination centre. In this period, when I wasn't walking the dog, I attempted to upgrade my web related skills, by refactoring some old websites from the later noughties. This is a continual learning process and I would be as happy to pursue this as find a fulfilling role in what is left of the print industry. In any event after six years experience of being an ex-prepress director I do feel well qualified to address my work-life balance.

        <h3>A few websites:</h3>

            <dd>
                We had been printing for <a href="https://rorypecktrust.org/">The Rory Peck Trust</a> for some ten years when the late <a href="https://www.frontlineclub.com/in_memoriam_juliet_crawley_peck_1961_-_2007/">Juliet Peck</a> introduced me to her friend Caherine Cairns who required a website but didn't really have the funds. I agreed to work gratis in return for a print order. A brochure was duly designed and produced and I developed my first website and duly handed it over for hosting. It has been regularly updated albeit in the most rudimentary fashion, by directly editing the html and the original semantic horror can still be discovered in the source code. Last year just as lockdown hit, I thought I would attempt a basic CMS (php, mysql, markdown) whilst making it responsive. I'm currently maintaining the CMS version - it lives on an old iMac - and this <a href="https://knavesmireboy.github.io/poloafrica/">github version</a>. I have recently been in touch with Catherine and, when the time is right, we shall see it through to fruition.

        <dt><a href="#">BN Thermic</a></dt>
            <dd>
                Our assocation with BN Thermic went back to the very early days of North Wolds, when they were known as Bush Nelson.
        With an extensive range of heating products their business was a great candidate for an integrated e-commerce solution, as indeed it has <a href="https://www.bnthermic.co.uk/">become</a>. But back in early 2006 the most pressing concern was getting all of their content out of Quark files and onto there web site and I was tasked with this endeavour. I now had a better idea of CSS but yet no knowledge of javascript, so I informed the chaps that this was always going to be a prototype. Even without the javascript there was a steep learning curve and proved an invaluable experience. Later that year it was handed over to <a href ="https://sq.gg/">Squeegee Design</a> who had created a custom CMS for another of our print clients, <a href="https://www.showtime-supplies.co.uk/">Showtime Supplies</a>. This is what the original version looked like summer 2006. I've amended a few links.

            <dd>
                I was approached by Sylvia Sharpe, treasurer of the<a href="https://yorkminster.org/get-involved/donate/york-minster-fund/">York Minster Fund</a>. Approaching retirement she was keen to launch a website that would support her new venture, breeding and rearing Alpacas.
                For this site I was keen to learn javascript in order to navigate a picture gallery. Jeremy Keith's recently published <a href="https://domscripting.com/book/">Dom Scripting</a> was simply the right book at the right time. It was a bible of best practice, primarily focused on educating designers and I believe crucial in re-habilitating an often maligned language. Until very recently the site was hosted at www.granaryalpacas.co.uk. The above link is the last live snapshot before this <a href="https://knavesmireboy.github.io/Alpacas/">refactor</a>.

            <dd>
                In the first few months after leaving North Wolds, before we got to spend a lot of our time with estate agents, I volunteered my services in producing the artwork, mostly adverts, for a programme promoting a charity golf event the company had supported for many years. I also attempted to enrol on an advanced web design course, in the event it was barely intermediate, but I went ahead and in order to qualify for a certificate had to produce a three or four page website, which had to include a smattering of javascript and the ability to sumbit a form utilising the most typical input types. Actually don't believe the form had to work at all - server-side languages were not covered - and since github does not support them either - the form on this refactored version merely simulates a form submission. This may well be a candidate site in which to learn Node and React, at the very least I should work on a database, however non-trivial that will be, although arguably more fun than producing a CV.

        <article><h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>I met my girlfriend on a walking holiday and we still enjoy doing that. The three of us hope to be posing by the Thames Flood Barrier within the month when we shall have completed the 189 mile journey from the Source. It will only have taken four years.
            Happiness is a chilled white and a plate of oysters within co-ee of an ocean. I do enjoy cooking from scratch most evenings and, though I hesitate to call it a hobby, no dimly lit sheds are involved, I do enjoy producing a well made cocktail.
            I have Ian Fleming to thank for that and when it comes to those films after all these years I still can't decide between From Russia With Love and Goldfinger.</p>
