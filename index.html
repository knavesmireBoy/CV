        <h3>WEB</h3>
                <p>The goal in refactoring some of these sites was to produce a responsive and progressively enhanced experience whilst reducing dependencies on external libraries.</p>
        <dl><dt>Poloafrica</dt>
            <dd>
                We had been printing for <a href="https://rorypecktrust.org/" target="_blank">The Rory Peck Trust</a> for some ten years when the late <a href="https://www.frontlineclub.com/in_memoriam_juliet_crawley_peck_1961_-_2007/" target="_blank">Juliet Peck</a> introduced me to her friend Catherine Cairns who required a website but didn't really have the funds being requested by the organisations she'd approached. As I had a lot to learn on this project I agreed to work gratis in return for a print order. A brochure was designed and produced and I developed my first website and duly handed it over for hosting. Third parties have regularly updated it, albeit in the most rudimentary fashion, directly editing the html and the original semantic horror can still be discovered in the source code. Last year, just before lockdown hit, I thought I would attempt a basic CMS (php, mysql, markdown) whilst making the site responsive. I'm currently maintaining the CMS version - it lives on an old iMac - and this <a href="https://knavesmireboy.github.io/poloafrica/" target="_blank">github version</a>. I have recently been in touch with Catherine and, when the time is right, we hope to see it through to fruition. The original site is still hosted <a href="http://www.poloafrica.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.

        <dt>BN Thermic</dt>
            <dd>
                The assocation with BN Thermic went back to the very early days of North Wolds, when they were known as Bush Nelson.
        With an extensive range of heating products their business was a great candidate for an integrated e-commerce solution, as indeed it has <a href="https://www.bnthermic.co.uk/" target="_blank">become</a>. But back in early 2006 the most pressing concern was getting all of their content out of Quark files and on to their web site and I was tasked with this endeavour. I now had a better idea of CSS but yet no knowledge of javascript, so I informed the chaps that this was always going to be a prototype. Even without the javascript there was a steep learning curve and the exercise proved to be an invaluable experience. Later that year it was handed over to <a href ="https://sq.gg/" target="_blank">Squeegee Design</a> who had created a custom CMS for another of our print clients, <a href="https://www.showtime-supplies.co.uk/" target="_blank">Showtime Supplies</a>. <a href="https://knavesmireboy.github.io/bnthermic/" target="_blank">This</a> is what the original version looked like in the summer of 2006 and the design held good for a number of years.

        <dt>Granary Alpacas</dt>
            <dd>
                Having worked together on a number of print projects I was approached by Sylvia Sharpe of the <a href="https://yorkminster.org/get-involved/donate/york-minster-fund/" target="_blank">York Minster Fund</a> to work on a website that would support her post-retirement venture, breeding and rearing Alpacas.
                For this site learning javascript was a requirement as navigating a picture gallery was firmly on the wish list. Jeremy Keith's recently published <a href="https://domscripting.com/book/" target="_blank">Dom Scripting</a> was simply the right book at the right time. It was a bible of best practice, primarily focused on educating designers and, I believe helped usher in the age of the modern website. It is sadly no longer hosted at www.granaryalpacas.co.uk, but looked liked this the last time I worked on it in <a href="https://knavesmireboy.github.io/legacy_alpacas/" target="_blank">2011</a>.
                This is the current refactored, responsive <a href="https://knavesmireboy.github.io/Alpacas/" target="_blank"> version</a> maintained for fun.
            </dd>
        <dt>The Little Cocktail Site</dt>
            <dd>
                In the first few months after leaving North Wolds, before we got to spend a lot more time with estate agents, I volunteered my services in producing the artwork for a programme promoting a charity golf event which North Wolds had supported for many years. I also enrolled on what should have been an advanced web design course, but wasn't. I went ahead and in order to qualify for a certificate had to produce a three or four page website, which had to include a smattering of javascript and a form comprising the most common input types. It was not a requirement that the form would actually submit, server-side languages were not covered. Since github does not support them either the form on this <a href="https://knavesmireboy.github.io/cocktail/" target="_blank">update</a> merely simulates a form submission. It's a hobby site and may be a candidate on which to learn a different stack.</dd></dl>

        <h2>PROFILE</h2>
        <p>Self-motivated and largely self-taught individual who made a decisive contribution to the success and development of the - part - family printing business. Over 35 years I had to master a range of disciplines in responding to the challenges and opportunities presented to an industry fast pivoting towards an entirely digital workflow. 
        </p>
        <p>But digital has been a double-edged sword for the print industry as more content is consumed online, the last couple of years alone providing ample evidence of our dependence on online technologies. It was this direction of travel that encouraged me to double-down on my web skills, as detailed below.</p>

            <header><h3>Full-time Litho Press Operator</h3></header>
            <article>
                     <p>I progressed from small offset single colour presses to producing process colour jobs on Komori Sprint(2/4) and Lithrone(4/5) colour presses. For the vast majority of this period, however, I operated a succession of Komori Sprint 2-colour presses and it was on these machines that I truly honed my craft, exposed as I was to a huge variety of work on a diverse range of materials.</p>
                <p>The demands of producing accurate four colour work on a two-colour press with purely manual controls can only be
                    underestimated. Within a few short years I was in a position to provide press tuition to new recruits.</p></article></section>

            </header>
            <article>
        <p>After several years on the presses I was keen to establish a repro department and in due course a darkroom and studio were
            purposely built and I cut my teeth handling simpler single/spot/halftone work before gaining the confidence to prepare the firm's process colour work.</p>
                <p>Strategic partnerships were formed with established repro houses for high-end scanning and proofing services. This was an inherently more client-facing role, I was able to get away from the shop floor as I did my rounds visiting graphic designers and repro houses. As the company’s order book grew the department was able to offer an apprenticeship to a former work experience student, who quickly excelled when the digital age dawned.</p></article>

            <article>
            <p>At <a href="https://www.printweek.com/event/article/ipex-bows-out-after-nearly-140-years">Ipex</a> in 1993 the company made its first investment in digital kit. The software we were obligated to learn initially comprised QuarkXpress 3.1, Freehand 3.1 and Photoshop 2.5. This holy trinity of software was beginning to reach maturity, particularly on the Apple Mac platform and rapid turnaround of printed material would soon be a reality. But the brave new world of digital output was fraught with peril and the role of prepress was crucial in an ensuring that equally rapid reprints would not eventuate.</p></article></section>

                <header><h3><em>Pre-Press Director</em><em>Graphic/Web Design</em><em>Imagesetter/CTP Operator</em></h3></header>        
        <article><p>Just before the end of the millennium the firm finally invested in a imagesetter. This paid dividends when we were able to secure a contract to provide a total print solution for a major York based insurance company. The ranks of the repro department swelled and now included two ex-press operators, so whether sending files direct to the imagesetter or occasionally sending pdf files via iSDN for external output, clients could be assured that there files had been subjected to a professional degree of scrutiny.</p>
            <p>The general trend towards a pdf workflow culminated in the investment of a computer-to-plate system powered by  <a href="https://www.printweek.com/news/article/north-wolds-goes-on-200k-agfa-ctp-spree-at-northprint">Agfa's Apogee Pre-Press workflow</a> with plate output on the Acento, their chemistry free platesetter. With proofs now produced from ripped files for the first time the department had finally come of age.</p><p>Along with the core responsibilities of pre-flighting the department had also, since the advent of digital, been able to provide decent graphic design services across a range of printed products. When more than one client began expressing an interest for an online presence I soon realised there was whole new order of technologies to explore.

            <section><ul><li>10</li><li>14</li></ul><header><h3><em>Pre-Press Director</em><em>Digital Press Operator</em></h3></header>
                <article>
            <p>The last major investment in the department, on my watch, was a digital press, which was installed at the end of 2009, the year the firm moved to it's present premises. It was largely my responsibility to research the options available, but the directors were unanimous in deciding, within the constraints of the budget, that the <a href="assets/km.jpeg">Konica Minolta bizhub PRO c6501</a> gave the most litho-like results, very much a consideration. I was also determined to exploit the the very non-litho-like advantage of the digital press, and invest in a variable data solution. KM offered the entry-level <a href="https://bigpicture.net/article/creos-darwin-vi-tool-indesign-cs" target="_blank">Darwin</a> plug-in for InDesign. It had it's limitations, as did digital print in general, but we were now able to offer our clients an exciting new opportunity and the demand was there from the start.</p><p>It was also in this period that I made an attempt to upgrade the company website. An upload facility was the first priority. This side-project was my first real venture into programming proper as it soon became apparent that a database-driven website was in order. I had to become familiar with concepts such as database normalisation as I began to grapple with the minute particulars of mysql and php, and although I wouldn’t have known it at the time the knowledge of the SQL language would soon prove to be of real practical benefit when it came to preparing the Excel spreadsheets required for our variable data solution.</p></article></section> 
        <section>
            <ul><li>15</li><li>21</li></ul><header><h3>Refactoring</h3></header>
            <article><p>Around 2012 retirement beckoned for one of the original directors and in due course it was decided to initiate the process of selling the business, which was <a href="https://www.printweek.com/news/article/singh-returns-to-print-with-buyout-deal" title="printweek article" target="_blank">completed</a> in July 2014. I was on holiday at the time and as I suspected I was soon to have a lot more time on my hands.</p><p>Several house moves followed as my partner pursued new opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry, one house became our home and I was fortunate to have the leisure to oversee some significant home improvements and decorate the place from top to toe. It wasn’t just the dalmatian that benefited from this furlough.</p>
<p>In the meantime I had a few print projects from ex-clients, volunteering my services on occasion but I was primarily interested in upgrading my web skills in particular gaining greater literacy with javascript.</p>
<p>Discovering object-oriented design patterns was a revelation but true eloquence may lay more on the functional side of JS. The only ex-project that would resemble a modern app however was the old upload site, written entirely in php. Significantly refactored it is in a much better state to port over to a JS framework as a further learning exercise.</p>
<p>However much fun that may be it can wait a while. I can hardly afford to be a "gentleman coder" for the rest of my days, it is a new year and high time I did something about my work-life balance. I possess a clean driving licence, I shouldn’t be let anywhere near a HGV.</p></article></section></div></section></main></div>
