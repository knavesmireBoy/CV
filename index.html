            <p>I “designed” a variety of items whilst at North Wolds. These best <strong>demonstrate a degree of familiarity</strong> with the Adobe Creative Suite, click to view.</p>

        <h3>WEB</h3>
                <p>Listed below chronologically in the order I first worked on them. The <strong>BNTHERMIC</strong> site hasn't changed since the summer of 2006. <strong>POLOAFRICA</strong> and those <strong>ALPACAS</strong> have gone a few rounds of re-factoring, but <strong>modernizr.js</strong> and <strong>underscore.js</strong> are the only dependencies, and there has been a degree of consideration for older browsers. <strong>Unlike a broken elevator a broken escalator degrades gracefully to a flight of steps...</strong></p>

        <h2>PROFILE</h2>
        <p>Self-motivated and largely self-taught individual who made a decisive contribution to the success and development of the - part - family printing business. Over 35 years I had to master a range of disciplines in responding to the challenges and opportunities presented to an industry fast pivoting towards an entirely digital workflow.

            <article>
                     <p>Operated several <strong>Komori Litho presses</strong> producing a wide range of printed materials on 2 and 4 colour litho presses. For the majority of this period the firms four colour work was produced on two-colour presses without the benefit of automated controls, despite these limitations the company established an enviable reputation for excellent colour work delivered at speed.  Within a few short years I was in a position to provide tuition to new recruits.</p></article></section>

        <p>Established the <strong>pre-press department</strong> quickly developing the skills to convert artwork to press-ready final film resulting in huge productivity gains. Duties included liasing with clients, liasing with repro-houses, for scanning and chromalin proofing services, maintaining stock levels and platemaking. As the workload increased I took on an ex-works experience student as apprentice, who quickly excelled.</p></article>

            <article>
            <p>The firm invested in digital kit in late 1993 and within due course I utilised software skills to provide <strong>design solutions</strong> for print clients: <strong>Quark, InDesign, Freehand, Illustrator and Photoshop</strong>. But the core responsibilities were developing the pre-flight routines to ensure that digital output was flawless. My press experience proved invaluable in this regard. I also championed the adoption of pdf as robust mechanism for ensuring file integrity when sending files for output down the <strong>iSDN</strong> line.</p><p>As the department transitioned away from conventional techniques I was responsible for <strong>guiding investment in hardware, software and personnel</strong> as the print industry underwent profound change due to the remorseless advance of digital technologies.</p></article></section>

        <article><p>A succession of image/plate setters culminated in the <a href="https://www.printweek.com/news/article/north-wolds-goes-on-200k-agfa-ctp-spree-at-northprint" target="_blank">investment</a> in Agfa's Acento chemistry-free plate setter and their <strong>Apogee Pre-Press workflow</strong> for driving output for litho, and later, digital work. Masterinmg this software was paramount for the successful operation of the modern pre-press department.</p><p>When more than one client requested an online presence I devoted a considerable amount of out of office hours developing the skill-set required for producing bespoke web pages: <strong>HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, MYSQL</strong>.</p>
            <p>I once again enjoyed printing when the company finally invested in a digital press in the form of the Konica Minolta c6501 which included an online saddle-stitch finishing unit, producing both standard and variable data printed materials.</p>

                <header><h3>Refactoring</h3></header>
            <article><p>The firm was <a href="https://www.printweek.com/news/article/singh-returns-to-print-with-buyout-deal" title="printweek article" target="_blank">sold</a> in 2014 and my partner's pharmaceutical background has determined a succession of moves, but we, and the dalmatian have been happily settled in Alderley Edge for a number of years.  I had a few print projects from ex-clients, volunteering my services on occasion but I was primarily interested in upgrading my web skills, in particular gaining greater literacy with javascript.  The most recent refactor was the php/mysql database driven <a href="https://knavesmireboy.github.io/poloafrica/?cv" target="_blank">site</a> that I had developed to enable client's to upload files. Specific languages are secondary to the ability to code. Once we learn to drive we can get used to most cars. Speaking of which I possess a clean driving licence.</p>
